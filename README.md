In order to set up the development environment for this system, you must download Maven and add the path of it's bin folder to your computer's environment variables. You must then install Python and run the 'pip install pyzmq and pip install jsonschema' command in the terminal. When launching the application through the Maven command 'mvn javafx:run' you will be presented with a login page. The following are valid login credentials that can be used to log in to the system:

Username: destiny   Password: harper
